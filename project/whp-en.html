          <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            This project analyzes World Happiness data to identify which factors are most associated with the Happiness Index and how these relationships can be converted into a reliable predictive model. The initiative combines statistical exploration, data cleaning and standardization, feature engineering and model evaluation, ensuring a reproducible preparation and training flow. As a practical delivery, the work provides an interactive dashboard with map and correlation visualizations, allowing pattern investigation by country and variable comparison over time. The result is a solid foundation both for understanding happiness determinants and for future analytical and predictive applications.

        <section id="perguntas" class="report-section">
          <h2>2. Analysis questions</h2>
          <p>
            The guiding questions are: which factors show the strongest association with the Happiness Index; how this index evolves over time; how it is distributed across regions and countries; and whether it is possible to predict the index from socioeconomic and institutional variables, such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, freedom of choice and trust in government.

          <p>
            In exploration, the objective is to visualize the temporal evolution of the index and understand how explanatory variables relate to it. Scatter plots with trend lines help identify stronger or weaker associations, while the map provides a quick and intuitive global overview.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dashboard consolidates exploration into three main pages: overview, map and correlations.
            It allows year filtering and pattern comparison without opening notebooks, making the project more presentable and easier to navigate.

          <h3>4.1 Evolution over time</h3>
          <p>
            The happiness index shows a sharp drop between 2005 and 2008, followed by gradual recovery. This trend may be related to global events such as the 2008 financial crisis, which negatively affected well-being in many countries. From 2010 onward, a consistent recovery is observed, although pace varies across nations, suggesting local and regional factors also play an important role in index evolution.
          </p>

          </div>

          <h3>4.2 Global Happiness Index map</h3>
          <p>
            The map reveals a clear geographical distribution, with Nordic countries such as Finland, Denmark and Norway consistently at the top of the ranking, while developing nations face greater challenges to achieve high happiness levels. The visualization highlights regional disparities and suggests that cultural, economic and social factors strongly influence population well-being.
          </p>
          <div class="chars">
            <img src="../assets/images/world_happiness/world-happiness-prediction-report_Page3.png" alt="Happiness Index map by country" />
          </div>
          <h3>4.3 Correlations between variables</h3>

          <p>
            Correlations help explain what moves together with the happiness index. In general, indicators such as GDP per capita, life expectancy and freedom of choice tend to track index growth, while variables linked to institutional trust may show less linear patterns depending on the segment.
          </p>
          <p>
            This behavior reinforces the idea that well-being is multifaceted and depends on a combination of economic, social and institutional factors. Correlation analysis also guides feature selection for predictive modeling, highlighting variables with higher explanatory potential.

          <h2>5. Happiness Index prediction</h2>

          <p>
            In addition to exploratory analysis and visualizations, the project also includes a predictive
            modeling stage aimed at estimating the Happiness Index from socioeconomic and institutional
            variables. The proposal is to transform observed patterns in data into quantitative forecasts,
            enabling scenario simulation and deeper understanding of factors that influence average country well-being.
          </p>

          <h3>5.1. Data preparation for modeling</h3>

          <p>
            Before model training, data went through a machine learning-oriented preparation process,
            ensuring consistency and avoiding information leakage between train and test sets.
          </p>

          <p>
            Main steps included explanatory variable selection, target variable definition,
            missing value handling, normalization when needed, and train/test split while preserving experiment reproducibility.
          </p>

          <h3>5.2. Evaluated models</h3>

          <p>
            Supervised regression models were used to predict a continuous value corresponding
            to the Happiness Index. A simple baseline model was adopted first, followed by more robust models
            capable of capturing non-linear relationships between variables.
          </p>

          <p>
            Final model selection considered not only numerical performance, but also
            stability, interpretability and generalization capability.
          </p>

          <h3>5.3. Performance evaluation</h3>

          <p>
            Model performance was evaluated using classic regression metrics,
            enabling an objective assessment of prediction quality.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>R²: measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.</li>
            <li>MAE: represents mean absolute prediction error.</li>
            <li>RMSE: penalizes larger errors and indicates residual dispersion.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The obtained results indicate that the model captures a significant share of Happiness Index variation, with average errors compatible with the analyzed indicator scale.

              </table>
            </div>
              <p>
                After evaluation, the Random Forest model showed the best performance, with R² of 0.856 and RMSE of 0.410, indicating strong explanatory power with relatively low average error. The Linear Regression model, although capturing the general trend, performed worse, suggesting that relationships between explanatory variables and the index are not strictly linear. XGBoost also showed competitive performance, but Random Forest stood out as the best option for this specific dataset.
              </p>
          <h3>5.4. Variable importance</h3>

          <p>
            Variable contribution analysis showed that factors related to material conditions,
            social support and individual autonomy have stronger impact on predictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the most relevant variables are indicators such as GDP per capita,
            life expectancy, social support and freedom of choice, confirming patterns
            previously observed in exploratory analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables associated with institutional perception, such as trust in government,
            show less stable influence, varying by region and period.
          </p>
          <div class="chars">
            <img src="../assets/images/world_happiness/importancia_rf.png" alt="Variable importance - Random Forest" />
          </div>
          <h3>5.6. Predictive stage conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            The prediction stage demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the Happiness Index with good
            precision using socioeconomic and well-being variables. The model not only produces forecasts,
            but also contributes to understanding factors that sustain globally observed happiness levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way, modeling complements visual analyses, turning historical data
            into an analytical tool that supports comparative studies and evidence-based discussions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="conclusao" class="report-section">
          <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            The project shows how social and economic data can be transformed into visual analysis and a predictive approach, connecting exploration, interpretation and final product (dashboard). The result is a clear view of Happiness Index behavior over time and space, plus a consistent path for estimating the index from explanatory variables.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="proximos" class="report-section">
          <h2>7. Next steps</h2>
          <p>
            As an evolution path, it is possible to add model comparison, variable-importance analysis, temporal validation (train on earlier years and test on later years), and an explainability layer (for example, SHAP) to make predictions more interpretable. In the dashboard, a "Prediction vs Actual" tab and a ranking of countries with highest error can produce valuable insights.
