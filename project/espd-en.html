            <h2>1. Context</h2>
            <p>
              In ecommerce operations, delivery is one of the strongest drivers of customer experience.
              Delays, logistics failures and poorly calibrated lead-time promises directly affect perception,
              repeat purchase and reputation. In a competitive scenario, logistics is no longer just operations:
              it becomes part of the product value proposition.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project organizes delivery performance into a Power BI dashboard and complements
              it with Python notebooks, including data exploration, feature engineering and a predictive
              model to estimate customer satisfaction from purchase and delivery signals.

            <h2>3. KPIs and definitions</h2>

            <p>
              The dashboard was designed to answer business questions with simple, actionable metrics.
              Key indicators include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Average delivery time: average number of days for delivered orders.</li>
              <li>% delivered on time: share of orders delivered within SLA.</li>
              <li>% delayed: share of orders delivered outside SLA.</li>
              <li>GMV: gross revenue associated with orders (delivered and total).</li>
              <li>Average ticket: average value per order.</li>
              <li>Average rating: customer satisfaction for on-time vs delayed deliveries.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              A key point in this dashboard is the time-based reading, because it separates seasonal peaks from trend.
              This avoids rushed interpretations, where one-off oscillations are treated as structural failures.
            </p>
          </section>

            <h2>4. Dashboard and pages</h2>
            <p>
              The dashboard was split into pages for layered reading: first executive overview,
              then operations and SLA, and finally evolution and trend.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Analytics in Python</h2>

            <p>
              Beyond the dashboard, the project includes Python notebooks to deepen analysis and ensure
              decision traceability. The objective is to support conclusions with analytical evidence,
              guaranteeing that interpretations are backed by data.
            </p>

            <h3>5.1. Integration and analytical dataset</h3>
            <p>
              The analytical base is built by integrating ecommerce dataset tables (orders, items, payments,
              reviews and customer information). From that, ready-to-use variables are generated to answer
              operations and business questions.

            <h3>5.3. Logistics feature engineering</h3>
            <p>
              To measure SLA and delay consistently, the notebook creates time-based variables such as:
              expected delivery time, real delivery time and the gap between them. From this gap, an
              operational label is created (delayed or not delayed) for analysis and ML modeling.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>expected_days: days between purchase and estimated delivery date.</li>
              <li>gap_delivery_days: difference between delivered and estimated date (how much SLA was exceeded).</li>
              <li>is_delayed: delay flag derived from delivery gap.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5.4. Segmented reading</h3>
            <p>
              With the dataset ready, Python helps validate patterns that become BI narrative:
              regional variation, seasonality, delay concentration by state and impact signals on customer behavior.
              The notebook acts as an investigation environment, and Power BI consolidates the executive narrative.

          <section id="ml" class="report-section">
            <h2>6. Machine Learning prediction</h2>

            <p>
              The ML stage answers a practical question: is it possible to anticipate low-satisfaction risk using signals already available at purchase and delivery time?
            </p>

            <h3>6.1. Problem and target variable</h3>
            <p>
              The model is framed as binary classification of customer satisfaction based on review score.
              The rule is straightforward: scores 4 or 5 represent "satisfied" (positive class), and lower scores
              represent "not satisfied" (negative class). It is a pragmatic choice because 4 and 5 usually indicate a good experience.
            </p>

            <h3>6.2. Features used in the model</h3>
            <p>
              The notebook uses a feature set mixing price, freight, payment, category, state and logistics signal.
              Main features include:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>freight_value, price</li>
              <li>payment_installments, payment_type</li>
              <li>product_category_name, customer_state</li>
              <li>expected_days, gap_delivery_days, is_delayed</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Since the dataset is imbalanced, training includes class weighting in models that support it,
              reducing bias toward the majority class.
            </p>

            <h3>6.3. Tested models</h3>
            <p>
              Three models were compared with focus on interpretability and performance:
              Logistic Regression (baseline), Random Forest (non-linear) and XGBoost (boosting).

            <h3>6.4. Results interpretation</h3>
            <p>
              Random Forest delivers the best overall performance (highest accuracy and best class-1 F1), while keeping high
              precision and recall for class 1. XGBoost is close in overall accuracy and class-1 F1, but it is weaker at
              identifying class 0 (very low recall), despite reasonable precision in that class. Logistic Regression has the
              lowest overall performance, but recovers more class-0 cases (higher recall), albeit with low precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model objective is to anticipate low-satisfaction risk (class 0), so recall in this class is a key indicator.
              In this sense, Logistic Regression, despite being the simplest model, remains relevant for recovering more
              dissatisfaction cases, even with many false positives. Random Forest is a strong balanced option, while XGBoost,
              despite its sophistication, does not recover class 0 well in this specific case.

            <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              The project consolidates an integrated view of logistics performance, connecting operational indicators
              (SLA, delay and non-delivery) with business metrics (GMV, average ticket and rating).
            </p>
            <p>
              Power BI supports executive and operational reading through storytelling. Python deepens the analysis,
              ensures traceability and adds a predictive layer to anticipate low-satisfaction risk.
            </p>
            <p>
              The result is a set of deliverables that speeds up decision-making, provides analytical support for choices
              and opens the path to evolve the initiative into an analytical product.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the ML front, results show potential to anticipate dissatisfaction, but also reveal the impact
              of class imbalance. Models perform well on the satisfied class, but recover little of class 0.
              For further evolution, it is worth testing balancing techniques, threshold tuning and feature enrichment,
              while calibrating objectives according to the cost of each error type.

          <section id="proximos" class="report-section">
            <h2>8. Next steps</h2>
            <p>
              Natural next steps include model threshold calibration (to prioritize class-0 recall),
              explainability exploration (feature importance and SHAP on XGBoost), and new feature testing such as
              approximate distance, regional logistics density, and carrier-level cuts (if data is available).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is also possible to turn results into a monitoring flow: when low-satisfaction risk rises,
              trigger operational intervention (promised lead-time review, route prioritization, proactive contact).
