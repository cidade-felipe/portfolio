         <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
         <p>
            Online education grew significantly, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.
            In this context, educational institutions had to adapt and implement new technologies,
            which led to stronger technology integration in teaching. In addition, online education
            made course access easier for students in remote areas, contributing to democratization of access to education.
         </p>
         <p>
            This work aims to perform exploratory data analysis to understand student and course characteristics,
            identify factors that influence course completion through engagement patterns, and generate actionable insights
            for follow-up.

            The dataset contains student information, such as age, gender, time spent on the platform,
            educational background, among others, and course information, such as course name,
            duration, price, and others. The target variable is in the
            "Completed" column, indicating whether the student completed the course.

         <h2>5. Visual analysis and insights</h2>
         <p>
            Exploratory data analyses were performed to understand factors
            that influence course completion through engagement patterns.
         </p>
         <h3>Missed assignments vs completion</h3>
         <p>
            Students who completed the course have a lower median of missed assignments and a
            more concentrated distribution. Those who did not complete show greater dispersion and higher
            maximum values. This suggests that missing assignments is not an isolated event, but a
            recurring behavior associated with dropout. A student does not drop out because they
            missed one assignment, but due to progressive disengagement caused by a sequence of missed tasks.
         </p>
            <div class="chars">
               <img src="../assets/images/sccp/Boxplot_atividades_perdidas.png" alt="Boxplot comparing missed assignments between students who completed and did not complete the course" >
            </div>
         <h3>Days since last login</h3>
         <p>
            Students who completed the course tend to have fewer days since last login, with most
            values concentrated near zero. Students who did not complete show long tails,
            with many cases of long periods without access. The longer the time without logging in,
            the lower the chance of completion.
         </p>
         <div class="chars">
               <img src="../assets/images/sccp/Boxplot_dias_desde_ultimo_login.png" alt="Boxplot comparing days since last access between students who completed and did not complete the course" >
            </div>

         <h3>Total time dedicated to the course</h3>
         <p>
            Students who completed the course show a clearly higher median of dedicated hours,
            with distribution shifted toward higher values. Students who did not complete
            concentrate on fewer hours, with some outliers indicating occasional attempts
            but no consistency.
         </p>
         <p>
            Here we see the difference between continuous effort and sporadic effort. Dedicating more
            time does not guarantee completion, but dedicating little almost guarantees the opposite.
         </p>

               <img src="../assets/images/sccp/Boxplot_tempo_gasto_vs_conclusão.png" alt="Boxplot comparing total time dedicated to the course between students who completed and did not complete the course" >
            </div>
         <h3>Video completion rate</h3>
         <p>
            The distribution of students who completed is clearly shifted toward higher
            video consumption rates, while students who did not complete concentrate in medium
            and lower values. This indicates that watching content through to the end is a strong proxy
            for real engagement. It is not just accessing the platform, but consuming content consistently.
         </p>
            <div class="chars">
               <img src="../assets/images/sccp/Histograma_taxa_de_conclusao_de_vIdeos.png" alt="Histogram comparing video completion rate between students who completed and did not complete the course" >
            </div>

         <h3>Effort versus performance</h3>
         <p>
            There is a general trend where more dedicated hours are associated with
            better quiz averages, but the most important aspect is visual group separation. Students
            who complete appear more often in the higher-effort and better-performance region,
            while those who do not complete are more spread across low and
            intermediate levels.
         </p>
         <p>
            This chart is great for discussion because it shows that effort helps, but does not
            explain everything. Some students study a lot and still do not complete, opening room
            for factors such as organization, conceptual difficulties or personal context.
         </p>

            </div>

         <h3>Correlation between variables</h3>
         <p>
            Correlations with the Completed variable are moderate, not exaggerated, which is
            expected in real behavioral data. Positive correlation stands out with
            Video_Completion_Rate and Assignments_Submitted, and negative correlation with
            Assignments_Missed. The strongest highlight in the map is the almost perfect negative correlation
            between Assignments_Submitted and Assignments_Missed, which is coherent and helps validate dataset consistency.

         <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
         <p>
            Exploratory data analysis revealed that factors influencing course completion
            are multivariate, combining engagement, effort and academic performance.
            No single variable fully explains completion. Therefore,
            completion in online courses can be understood as a multivariate phenomenon,
            combining engagement, effort and academic performance.

               data layer, and adding more detailed regional comparisons.
